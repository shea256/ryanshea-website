## About

Here's some of my AI Art, produced using text-to-image AI models like DALLE.

Some of these pieces are produced in one shot. That is, I provided a text prompt and I received an image that I considered exactly what I wanted and I proceeded to publish.

Some other pieces, however, required quite a bit of interactive work. With these, I would often go through many edits and iterations. That means (1) submitting my text prompt to the text-to-image model (2) iterating on the prompt until I find a great base image (3) editing the image on Figma or Photoshop (4) resubmitting the edited images and asking the text-to-image model to expand on my edits.

Below you'll find a curated list of my favorite creations. I hope you enjoy.
