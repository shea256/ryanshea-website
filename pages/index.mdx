Hey, my name is Ryan and I'm an engineer, an entrepreneur and an angel investor.

I co-founded Stacks, a top 100 cryptocurrency and one of the most popular platforms for blockchain apps, including MiamiCoin and NYCCoin.

I also co-founded Citizenbase, an app that makes it easy to see your ballot before you go to vote.

I invested in several unicorns including Lattice, Anchorage, OpenSea, Clubhouse, Saber, Filecoin and Embark, and I'm also an investor in SpaceX, Lightning, Loyal, Levels, Mercury and more.

I’m a longtime snowboarder and a newly converted kiteboarder. I like to weight-lift and breakdance.

I’m really into reading, particularly science fiction and philosophy. Ask me about my favorite books.
