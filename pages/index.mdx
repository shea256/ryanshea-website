Hey, my name is Ryan and I'm an engineer, an entrepreneur and an angel investor.

I co-founded [Stacks](https://www.stacks.co/), a top 100 cryptocurrency that brings smart contracts to Bitcoin.

I also co-founded [Voterbase](https://voterbase.com/), an app that makes it easy to see your ballot before you go to vote.

I invested in several unicorns including Lattice, Anchorage, OpenSea, Clubhouse, Saber, Filecoin, Embark, SpaceX and Eight Sleep.

I’m a longtime snowboarder and a newly converted kiteboarder. I like to weight-lift, run, meditate and breakdance.

I’m really into reading, particularly science fiction and philosophy. Ask me about my favorite books.
